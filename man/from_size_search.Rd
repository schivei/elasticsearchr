\title{Execute query with from-size search API.}
\usage{
from_size_search(rescource, api_call_payload)
}
\arguments{
\item{rescource}{An \code{elastic} rescource object describing on what documents the query is to
be execured on.}

\item{api_call_payload}{A character string containing the JSON payload that described the query
to be executed.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of documents returned from the query.
}
\description{
The from-size search API allows a maximum of 10,000 search results (the maximum 'size') to be
returned in one call to the API. The 'from' in the name of the API refers to where in the order
of all qualifying documents (as ordered by their search score), should results start to be
returned from. Anything larger than 10,000 and the results need to be fetched from using the
scroll-search API (which is slower as it involves making multiple call-back requests). This API
is particularly well suited to returning aggregation results.
